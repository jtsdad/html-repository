<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a newbie to web desigh, though I first learnt about computers over 50 years ago.</p>

<p>Since then, I qualified as an accountant and had a successful career in the Public Sector in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>I'm now going back to my computing roots in my well-earned retirement, purely for fun.</p>
